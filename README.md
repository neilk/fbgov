It is not easy to see the changes in Facebook's governance documents, so I made these 
cleaned-up documents. 



These are based on the documents I downloaded from Facebook at about Mon Dec 3 23:47:41 2012 -0800.

The Data Use Policy documents are all in one document in the proposed version, and broken into
many pages in the existing version. So I combined all the existing version pages into one, for
an easier comparison.

To verify that I haven't altered the contents, you can peruse the git history of this project.
I started with the raw files and then cleaned them up with scripts in this project and
HTML Tidy (/usr/bin/tidy in Mac OS X, released 2006-10-31 build 15.6).

I am not intending or suggesting that you 'fork' Facebook's policies to your own liking. 
These are simply for the benefit of Facebook users who want an easier way to see the changes 
in those documents, and to have some degree of assurance that I'm not altering what Facebook's
documents say.

If Facebook makes further changes to their proposed policies, I will try to keep current but
pull requests would be most welcome.
